# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:\n\
# The \"handy ruler\" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line\n\
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on\n\
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make\n\
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to\n\
# leave one space after the ':'.\n\
# \n\
